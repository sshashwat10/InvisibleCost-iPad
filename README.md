# The Invisible Cost
## Davos 2026 — Vision Pro Experience (Tier 2)

> *"Every organization carries a hidden cost. Most leaders never see it."*

A premium spatial narrative experience for Apple Vision Pro that reveals the hidden burden of modern work—the decisions, rework, friction, and operational drag that quietly erode human potential—and shows how agentic automation transforms that burden into clarity, speed, and meaningful human work.

**Runtime:** 4-5 minutes  
**Platform:** Apple Vision Pro (visionOS 1.0+)  
**Purpose:** Premium immersive demo for high-value executive engagements at Davos 2026

## The Narrative Arc

The experience follows a precise emotional progression:

**Pressure → Crisis → Pattern Break → Clarity → Human Return**

### Scene Breakdown

| Phase | Time | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| **Spatial Overwhelm** | 0:00-0:30 | Dim volumetric environment with floating app windows, notifications, ambient pressure hum. Space subtly compresses inward. |
| **Reality Crack** | 0:30-0:50 | Vertical beam of white light slices scene open. Everything freezes. *"Invisible work is costing more than you realize."* |
| **Human Fragment** | 0:50-1:30 | Volumetric human figures appear—fragmented, incomplete—representing exhausted workers across Finance, Healthcare, Supply Chain. |
| **Data Choreography** | 1:30-2:30 | Central geometric object assembles from floating data points. Chaos becomes clarity. User can look around freely. |
| **Human Restoration** | 2:30-3:30 | Fragmented figures become whole. Color returns—teal, gold, warm white. Workers thrive, not just survive. |
| **Exit Moment** | 3:30-4:30 | Closing narrator. Volumetric CTA wraps around user's periphery. Connection to Imagine 2026. |
