## Cost Calculation Formulas (Tarani-Approved)

All formulas simplified for Davos 2026:

| Department | Formula | Example (1,000 employees) |
|------------|---------|---------------------------|
| **P2P** | $24 savings × employees × 15 transactions | $24 × 1,000 × 15 = **$360,000** |
| **O2C** | $18.50 savings × employees × 15 transactions | $18.50 × 1,000 × 15 = **$277,500** |
| **Customer Support** | $14.50 savings × customers × avg_org_size × 10 | $14.50 × 100 × 500 × 10 = **$7,250,000** |
| **ITSM** | $38 savings × customers × avg_org_size × 15 | $38 × 100 × 500 × 15 = **$28,500,000** |

**Cost Breakdown Split:**
- Direct Labor: 60%
- Overhead & Loaded: 25%
