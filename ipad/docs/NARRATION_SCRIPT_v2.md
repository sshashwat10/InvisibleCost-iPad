## PHASE 1: EMOTIONAL INTRO

### Opening 1
> "Every organization carries a hidden cost. One that doesn't appear on any balance sheet."

### Opening 2
> "Most leaders never quantify it. Until now."

---

## PHASE 2: DEPARTMENT SELECTION

### Choose Department
> "Select your process. We'll calculate the true operational cost."

---

## PHASE 3: DEPARTMENT INPUT

### Department Input
> "Enter your volumes. We'll apply industry benchmarks to calculate your hidden cost."

---

## PHASE 4: BUILDING TENSION
*Department-specific narrations*

### P2P (Procure-to-Pay)
> "Invoice processing. Every invoice requires matching... verification... approval. Your team executes this workflow thousands of times annually. Industry data reveals the true cost."

### O2C (Order-to-Cash)
> "Order to cash. Every order requires processing... credit verification... invoicing... collection. Each step introduces latency. Industry data reveals the true cost."

### Customer Support
> "Customer support. Every ticket requires intake... lookup... resolution. The same inquiries, processed repeatedly. Industry data reveals the true cost."

### ITSM (IT Service Management)
> "IT service management. Every request requires triage... assignment... resolution. Password resets alone consume significant capacity. Industry data reveals the true cost."

---

## PHASE 5: DEPARTMENT VIGNETTE
*Clinical observations while metrics display*

### P2P
> "Invoices accumulating. Cash flow constrained. Teams consumed by manual processing."

### O2C
> "Orders queued. Revenue delayed. Collection cycles extending."

### Customer Support
> "Tickets accumulating. Response times lengthening. Agents repeating the same resolutions."

### ITSM
> "Requests pending. Users waiting. Technical staff consumed by routine tasks."

---

## PHASE 6: PATTERN BREAK

### Pattern Break
> "What is the true operational cost?"

---

## PHASE 7: SUCKER PUNCH REVEAL

### Reveal (General)
> "This... is your invisible cost. Annually. Exposed."

*[Large animated cost number appears on screen]*

---

## PHASE 8: COST BREAKDOWN

### Cost Breakdown
> "Direct labor costs. Overhead allocation. And the hidden factors... exceptions, rework, opportunity cost."

---

## PHASE 9: COMPARISON CAROUSEL
*User swipes through comparison cards*

### P2P Comparisons
1. > "Full-time employees allocated entirely to manual processing."
2. > "Budget capacity redirected from strategic initiatives."
3. > "Productive hours consumed by repetitive manual tasks."

### O2C Comparisons
1. > "Revenue held in accounts receivable."
2. > "Working capital unavailable for operations."
3. > "Work weeks consumed by manual collection processes."

### Customer Support Comparisons
1. > "Agent capacity consumed by routine inquiries."
2. > "Hours spent on questions automation could resolve."
3. > "Customer wait time that erodes satisfaction."

### ITSM Comparisons
1. > "Cost of password resets alone."
2. > "User productivity lost waiting for IT resolution."
3. > "Technical staff time consumed by tier-one tickets."

### Transition
> "Ready to recover this capacity?"

---

## PHASE 10: AGENTIC ORCHESTRATION

### Agentic
> "Now consider: automation that operates across your entire system. AI agents that identify work, execute processes, and resolve issues... before escalation."

---

## PHASE 11: AUTOMATION ANYWHERE REVEAL

### AA Reveal (with Forrester)
