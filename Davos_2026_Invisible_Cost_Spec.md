Preamble --- The Invisible Cost Initiative

**The Invisible Cost** is a unified storytelling experience deployed
across Davos 2026 and Imagine 2026. It is designed to reveal the hidden
burden of modern work---the decisions, rework, friction, and operational
drag that quietly erode human potential. The narrative then shows how
agentic automation transforms that burden into clarity, speed, and
meaningful human work.

The project is delivered in three coordinated tiers, each adapted to its
environment but sharing the same emotional arc and message:

1.  **Tier 1 --- iPad + Headphones (Davos portable)**

> A compact, self-contained experience optimized for meetings, lounges,
> and personal interactions.

2.  **Tier 2 --- Apple Vision Pro (Davos immersive)**

> A premium spatial narrative that surrounds the viewer with the
> Invisible Cost and its transformation.

3.  **Tier 3 --- The Invisible Cost Corridor (Imagine walk-through)**

> A 1,500--2,000 sq ft physical installation that recreates the arc
> through spatial design, sound, projection, and movement.

Across all tiers, the story follows the same emotional progression:

**Pressure → Crisis → Pattern Break → Clarity → Human Return**

This ensures that whether a visitor engages through an iPad, a Vision
Pro headset, or a full walk-through experience, they receive a
consistent, emotionally resonant message about the promise of Agentic
Solutions.

The Davos tiers (1 & 2) serve as portable, executive-facing versions of
the story, while the Imagine installation (Tier 3) becomes the
large-scale physical embodiment of the same narrative---an anchor
experience for the conference foyer.

Together, these experiences form a cohesive, multi-tiered narrative that
elevates Automation Anywhere\'s leadership in Agentic Process Automation
and positions the company as defining the next era of enterprise work.

Executive Summary

This document specifies two portable experience tiers for Davos 2026,
designed to communicate the human value of agentic automation without
requiring a dedicated booth or complex AV infrastructure.

**Core Narrative:** Invisible work erodes human potential. Agentic
automation returns it.

**Emotional Arc:** Discomfort → Recognition → Crisis → Hope → Clarity →
Ownership

Narrator Frame (Both Tiers)

Both tiers open and close with a consistent narrator frame to establish
premium, editorial tone:

**Opening:** *\"Every organization carries a hidden cost. Most leaders
never see it.\"*

**Closing:** *\"Agentic automation returns invisible work to the people
who matter.\"*

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------

Tier 1: iPad + Headphones

**Estimated Runtime:** \~5 minutes

**Purpose:** Portable demo for executive meetings, VIP lounges, and
storefront handoffs

**Tone:** Human-first, strategic, emotionally intentional

Experience Flow

**0. Micro-Cold Open (00:00--00:07)**

Black screen with ambient tapping, typing, and notification hum. No
visuals yet---just sound. Creates a premium, cinematic opening that
signals intentionality.

*Enhancement: Single subtle haptic tap as audio begins.*

**1. Narrator Frame + Opening (00:07--00:37)**

Fade in. Narrator voice: *\"Every organization carries a hidden cost.
Most leaders never see it.\"*

Cinematic animation of notifications, overlapping windows, accelerating
timestamps. Voiceover: *\"You made 247 decisions today. 142 were
unnecessary.\"*

**2. Human Vignettes (00:37--01:15)**

Three **short, stylized emotional flashes** (4--6 seconds each) showing
invisible work erosion across Finance, Supply Chain, and Healthcare
roles. Abstract, not literal---designed for executive pacing.

*Enhancement: Subtle haptic taps during notification overwhelm moments.*

**3. Pattern Break (01:15--01:45)**

Screen wipes to white. Silence. Text fades in after a 1.5-second beat:

*\"What if this work... wasn\'t your work?\"*

*Enhancement: Single haptic tap on the question reveal.*

**4. Agentic Orchestration (01:45--02:45)**

Abstract visualization: parallel data collection, instant normalization,
risk scoring, clutter collapsing into clarity.

**5. Human Return (02:45--03:30)**

Workers shown restored---reviewing insights (not compiling them),
approving paths (not discovering problems).

**6. Personalization (03:30--04:30)**

**Single elegant slider:** \"How many hours of invisible work does your
team lose each week?\"

System automatically computes organizational impact. No multi-field
forms---premium simplicity for VIP interactions.

**7. Stillness + CTA (04:30--05:00)**

Audio **drifts to silence**. 1.5-second white pause. Then:

Narrator: *\"Agentic automation returns invisible work to the people who
matter.\"*

Final text: *\"What could your organization become with invisible work
returned?\"*

Subtle prompt: *\"Want the immersive version? Ask for the Vision Pro
demo.\"*

Tier 2: Apple Vision Pro

**Runtime:** 4--5 minutes

**Purpose:** Premium immersive version for high-value executive
engagements

**Units:** 2 Vision Pro devices

**Tone:** Vision-forward, precise, emotionally rich

Why Vision Pro?

Tier 2 elevates the Tier 1 narrative into a fully spatial, immersive
environment. It showcases how agentic automation *feels* when it
surrounds the user---not just appears on a screen. This is the virtual
version of the walk-through experience, delivering flagship impact in a
5×5 ft footprint.

Experience Flow

**1. Spatial Overwhelm (00:00--00:30)**

User enters a dim volumetric environment filled with floating app
windows, slow-motion notifications, ambient pressure hum, and subtle
inward compression of space.

Narrator: *\"Every organization carries a hidden cost. Most leaders
never see it.\"*

*Enhancement: One floating notification card drifts too close to the
user, then shatters into data dust. Creates immediate spatial presence.*

**2. Reality Crack (00:30--00:50)**

A vertical beam of white light slices the scene open. Everything
freezes. Sound cuts instantly. Text floats mid-air:

*\"Invisible work is costing more than you realize.\"*

*Enhancement: Use dramatic depth-of-field shift---near objects sharp,
background blur---then reverse as scene transitions.*

**3. Human Fragment (00:50--01:30)**

Volumetric human figures appear---fragmented, incomplete---representing
exhausted workers across Finance, Healthcare, and Supply Chain contexts.

*Enhancement: Figures subtly turn toward the user (5--10° rotation
max)---not creepy, just enough to feel acknowledged.*

**4. Data Choreography (01:30--02:30)**

A central geometric object assembles itself from floating data
points---representing parallel ingestion, normalization, scoring, and
synthesis. The user can look around freely as chaos becomes clarity.

**5. Human Restoration (02:30--03:30)**

The fragmented figures become whole. Color returns---teal, gold, warm
white. Workers are shown thriving, not just surviving.

**6. Exit Moment (03:30--04:30)**

Narrator: *\"Agentic automation returns invisible work to the people who
matter.\"*

*Enhancement: Volumetric CTA arc---a floating curve of text that wraps
around the user\'s periphery instead of a flat UI panel. Deeply spatial,
not sales-y.*

Deployment Scenarios

Scenario A: Storefront (10×10)

If the 10×10 storefront is available, both tiers can operate
simultaneously:

-   2 Vision Pro stations against back wall (5×5 each)

-   iPad station at front for queuing visitors or quick demos

-   Simple branded backdrop

-   1 staff member manages flow

Scenario B: No Fixed Space

If no booth is available, operate in roaming/meeting mode:

-   iPad + headphones carried to meetings, lounges, or hotel suites

-   Vision Pro deployed in pre-scheduled VIP sessions only

-   All equipment fits in 2 carry-on bags

Cross-Promotion: Davos → Imagine

Both Tier 1 and Tier 2 should include a subtle prompt connecting Davos
visitors to Imagine 2026:

*\"Want the full experience? Visit the Invisible Cost Corridor at
Imagine 2026.\"*

This reinforces the 3-tier strategy and creates continuity between
events.

Content Production Notes

Tier 1 content serves as the storyboard and timing blueprint for Tier 2.
Investment in Tier 1 production directly reduces Tier 2 costs.

-   All animations rendered at 4K for iPad, adapted to volumetric for
    Vision Pro

-   Voiceover and SFX stems delivered separately for localization

-   Modular scene structure allows individual segment updates

-   Color palette consistent with Automation Anywhere brand guidelines

-   Haptic patterns defined in content spec for iPad Pro implementation

  Vision Pro fit issues               Multiple light shields and optical
                                      inserts available
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

Recommended Next Steps

1.  Approve Tier 1 content production (\~\$2,500) to establish narrative
    baseline

2.  Confirm Vision Pro purchase decision (×2 units)

3.  Identify spatial content production partner for Tier 2

4.  Determine Davos deployment scenario (storefront vs. roaming)

5.  Schedule internal review of Tier 1 animatic before final production
